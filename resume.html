      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        I am currently a student at Dented Code Academy Sydney, pursuing a
        Full-stack development course to further my knowledge and skills. I
        recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from
        King's Own Institute. In addition to my studies, I work part-time in
        disability/mental services.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my academic journey, I gained practical experience through an
        internship at Adecco Group, where I honed my skills and contributed to a
        professional work environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a passionate technology enthusiast, my primary goal is to develop
        testable and effective code while focusing on creating exceptional user
        experiences and website layouts. I have a keen interest in integrating
        data from diverse databases and backend services. I am also dedicated to
        understanding and meeting technological requirements, enabling me to
        compile and refine specifications effectively.
